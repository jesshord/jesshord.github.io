            <p>This ended up being a lot more difficult than I expected! I first did a more complicated shape, but I was having a really hard time getting them to fit together, so I went to a simpler shape and focused on the fit.<br>
            <br>Here was my first design. The print failed, but I also realized the sizing wouldn’t work with the failed pieces.</p>

            <p><img src="images/as4/2.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>My second design was simple, but I spent a lot of time trying to get the fit to about a .15 mm difference in size for the tabs.</p>

            <p>The corner pieces fit nicely, but the top and bottom were still loose in the first iteration, so I went back and adjusted, and reprinted.</p>

            <p>You can see the looseness of the bottom piece in the picture below.</p>

            <p>Here’s the final piece after the adjustments and reprinting!</p>
