            <p>For this project, I wanted to have a bit more fun. I decided to try and make BMO from Adventure Time for my lamp.  <br>
            <p><img src="images/as6/7.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>First, I grabbed some inspiration from the internet, and then I drew some outlines in Illustrator. I exported those lines as a DXF file and opened them in Rhino. From there, I extruded and built the piece through Boolean Difference and Boolean Union. </p>

            <p><img src="images/as6/3.png" width=400></p>
            <p>It took a few tries and patching some holes, but I was able to make a shape that looks like him!</p>

            <p><img src="images/as6/5.png" width=400></p>
            <p>After that, I did some measurements and made a holder for the lightbulb and cord, as well as adding the holes on the side where the light will shine through.</p>
            <p><img src="images/as6/mockup.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>I printed the lightbulb holder first since it was the most important piece. The first print was successful because I realized I designed it in a way where I couldn't actually get the piece through *face palm*. I was able to tell from it that the hole I created for the bulb connector was perfectly sizd though. I also realized through this that my supports were waaaaay too strong and difficult to remove. So I made some adjustments and reprinted. Here is the successful holder. </p>
            <p><img src="images/as6/8.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>After this I made a little slot in the main structure for it to sit and printed the main structure. I adjusted the support settings to lines and 8% density so that they would be easier to remove. This print took a very long time and I had to use my Dog Camera to watch it while I left.</p>
            <p>One thing I noticed was that the entire print did not print. I looked up the max height for Ender 3 Pro and Cura said my file was fine, but it stopped printing. That ended up being okay and I just designed the lid based on the flat top.</p>
            <p><img src="images/as6/9alt.PNG" width=400></p>
            <p><img src="images/as6/10.png" width=400></p>
            <p><img src="images/as6/11.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p><img src="images/as6/12.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>After that I did a test with tape to see how the parchment paper would work, and it turned out even better than I imagined! It also  has enough room to switch out different types of light bulbs, so I put in a Phillips Hue.</p>

            <p><img src="images/as6/14.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>After this worked I sanded it with various sandpapers and super glued the parchment screen in. I decided not to do a cowboy hat because I liked the more minimal look of this, and designed a new lid for it. The cowboy hat mesh kept breaking on me anyways. Then, the issues began...</p>
            <p>1. The gears in the filament feeder are not moving. I try a lot of things. Turns out it somehow got unplugged.
            <br> 2. I start having adhesion issues, which I've never had. I re-level the bed. Doesn't work. I keep re-leveling until it's literally perfect and finally adhereing, takes an hour and half. I make sure the filament is extruding and there's no clog.
            <br>3. I go to print again. It still doesn't adhere, I'm getting upset. I take a break. 
            <br>4. Did my cat do this?
            <br>5. I think maybe a raft will help. The raft doesn't adhere. 
            <br>6. I rack my brain and think to turn it up to 60 degrees for the bed. THIS WORKS. I have to leave and watch it on the Dog Camera again.

            <p>After this, it was done!</p>
