            <p>I wanted to do something a little more challenging, but also cute, so I selected this <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-little-wizard-65716">wizard</a>. </p>
            <p>I stayed after class and ran my rough Rhino build by Nadya to make sure I was thinking about it correctly. After she approved it, I finished it up at home making sure everything was exact. I designed the mold parts seperately from the box and designed the box like a cake pan so that I can easily push the pieces out.</p>

            <h3>Thank yous!</h3>
            <p>Nadya for the help with where to put the holes and keys.</p>
