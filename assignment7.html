            <p>I wanted to do something a little more challenging, but also cute, so I selected this <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-little-wizard-65716">wizard</a>. </p>
            <p>I stayed after class and ran my rough Rhino build by Nadya to make sure I was thinking about it correctly. After she approved it, I finished it up at home making sure everything was exact. I designed the mold parts seperately from the box and designed the box like a cake pan so that I can easily push the pieces out.</p>
            <p><img src="images/as7/1.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>I printed them after many, many issues with my printer. My lamp was fine even though it was large, but something changed and I've been having a ton of issues. I think I have it ironed out now, but I had to change the nozzle. </p>
            <p>I printed the "pan" part of my 3D mold in a different color so it would be easy to tell them apart. </p>

            <p><img src="images/as7/3.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>I mixed the oomoo and made my mold.</p> 
            <p><img src="images/as7/4.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>The next day I cast my PerfectCast into it. It worked well, but the staff broke when I took it out and the hat was missing some of the plaster.</p>
            <p><img src="images/as7/5.png" width=400></p>
            <p>I tried shaking it more to get it more into the hat brim, but it didn't work. I also tried taking the staff out more gently and that also didn't work.</p>
            <p>I had an idea to take the plaster and put some into the brim first, put it together, and then cast. This worked!</p>
            <p><img src="images/as7/6.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>However, even though the staffs were casting fine, they broke everytime I took them out of the mold.</p>
            <p><img src="images/as7/8.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>I sanded them down, leaving a lot of the texture because I like it. I might glue the staffs back on at some point, but right now I just wanted to make them identical.</p>

            <h3>Things I Learned about Molding/Casting</h3>
            <p>1. If you are making a lot of these, it would be worth having two oomoo molds to cast plaster into.</p>
            <p>2. Smooth 3D print = Smooth plaster cast. Texture 3D print = Textured 3D cast. If I did this again (and had more time/less printer issues), I would print it with a smaller tolerance and slower speed so that the 3D mold was super smooth. Then add texture in the final piece. Doing it the way I did leads to more air bubbles. </p>
            <p>3. You can add some plaster to the deep sections of your mold if it's not coming out right.</p>
            <p>4. Plaster is easy to sand and work with after the fact! I really like it as a material.</p>
    
            
            <h3>Thank yous!</h3>
            <p>Nadya for the help with where to put the pour holes and keys.</p>
