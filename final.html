            <p><b>Concept</b><br>Propagation Station</p>
            <p><b>Use Case</b><br>A propagation station is essentially a “shelf” for propagating plants. Propagating plants is the process of taking a cutting, placing it in water/sunlight, and growing roots until you can plant it.<br>Plants from plants!</p>
            <p><b>Context</b><br>I have plants in random jars taking up my windowsill currently, and I want to make something that will look nicer. There's only one cup in this picture because I just planted my other propogated plants.</p>

            <p><b>Breakdown of Tasks</b><br>
            - Concepting &amp; Sketching<br>
            - 3D Modelling in Rhino<br>
            - 3D Printing Frame<br>
            - Laser Cutting Slats<br>
            - Incorporating Stock Parts (Tubes)<br>
            - Finishing and Documentation</p>

            <p><b>Timeline</b><br>
            This timeline was built with ranges to give myself extra time if needed.</p>
            <p><b>11/16</b> – Concepting, Sketching, &amp; Ordering Materials <br>
            <b>11/17 – 11/21</b> 3D Modelling in Rhino<br>
            <b>11/22</b> – Present Proposal<br>
            <b>11/23 – 11/26</b> – 3D Printing Tests <br>
            <b>11/26 – 11/28</b> (or until time to laser cut) – Print Frame<br>
            <b>11/28 – 12/1</b>  – Laser cut wood and test slat fit <br>
            <b> -  Contingency plan 1:</b> Can switch to acrylic or another material if there are issues with wood. <br>
            <b> -  Contingency plan 2:</b> If this fails, 3D print slats with an interference fit. <br>
            <b>12/2 – 12/4</b> – Finishing &amp; Photography<br>
            <b>12/5</b> – Code and submit documentation<br>
            <b>12/6</b> – Final Project Due</p>
