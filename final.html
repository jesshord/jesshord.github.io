            <h2>Proposal</h2>
            <p><img src="images/as8/1.jpg" width="400"></p>
            <p><b>Concept</b><br>Propagation Station</p>
            <p><b>Use Case</b><br>A propagation station is essentially a “shelf” for propagating plants. Propagating plants is the process of taking a cutting, placing it in water/sunlight, and growing roots until you can plant it.<br>Plants from plants!</p>
            <p><b>Context</b><br>I have plants in random jars taking up my windowsill currently, and I want to make something that will look nicer. There's only one cup in this picture because I just planted my other propogated plants.</p>

            <p><b>Breakdown of Tasks</b><br>
            - Concepting &amp; Sketching<br>
            - 3D Modelling in Rhino<br>
            - 3D Printing Frame<br>
            - Laser Cutting Slats (Contingency: Design slats with Grasshopper &amp; 3D Print)<br>

            <p>This timeline was built with ranges to give myself extra time if needed.</p>
            <p><b>11/16</b> – Concepting, Sketching, &amp; Ordering Materials <br>
            <b>11/17 – 11/21</b> 3D Modelling in Rhino<br>
            <b>11/22</b> – Present Proposal<br>
            <b>11/23 – 11/25</b> – 3D Printing Tests <br>
            <b>11/26 – 11/28</b> (or until time to laser cut) – Print Frame<br>
            <b>11/28 – 12/1</b>  – Laser cut wood and test slat fit <br>
            <b> -  Contingency plan 1:</b> Can switch to acrylic or another material if there are issues with wood. <br>
            <b> -  Contingency plan 2:</b> If this fails, 3D print slats designed with Grasshopper (can't do interference fit, need to easily come out). <br>

            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>I first created my model in Rhino based on the measurements of my window and rendered it. I made little models of the tubes so I could see what it looks like.</p>
            <p>I did model and render the wood slats, but I will be measuring the final 3D piece frame and designing the slats from that for a perfect fit when laser cutting.</p>
            <p><img src="images/as8/render1.jpg" width="400"></p>
            <p>During my presentation, Nadya mentioned I should add triangles to the frame for support and make the wood slats holding the tube one piece, so they don't push apart. So, I made those changes to my model.</p>
            <p><img src="images/as8/renderv2.jpg" width="400"></p>
            <p>I printed the frame in a quicker 6 hour print to make sure the sizing was exactly what I wanted. It was, so I did a longer 12 hour print of the frame. After this, it snowed on the day I was planning to go to the laser cutter. I was concerned about this throwing a wrench in my plans, so I created a parametic model in grasshopper for the slats and printed those just in case. </p>

            <p><img src="images/as8/3.jpg" width="400"><a></a></p>
            <p>The tubes fit well, next I did the laser cutting. For the file, I measured the printed 3D frame and built the size for the laser cutter file off of that. </p>

            <p><img src="images/as8/5.jpg" width="400"><a></a></p>
            <p><img src="images/as8/6alt.jpg" width="400"><a></a></p>
            <p>I sanded the pieces and then stained them with some darker stain. </p>
            <p><img src="images/as8/7.jpg" width="400"><a></a></p>
            <p>Here is the final piece in the window!</p>
            <p><img src="images/as8/8.jpg" width="400"><a></a></p>
            <p>And a clearer picture of it all! The two stands, modular wood slats, modular plastic slats, and some plants!</p>
            <p><img src="images/as8/final.jpg" width="400"><a></a></p>
            <p>Total techniques ended up being: Rhino, Grasshopper/Parametric Design, 3D Printing, Laser Cutting, and incorporating stock parts.  </p>
