            My name is Jessica Hord. I'm on my second year of my Masters degree (of three, I'm part-time). I currently work at T-Mobile as a UX designer full-time. Previously, I worked full-time as a Visual Designer. <br> <br>
            In terms of digital fabrication, I'm most interested in physical prototyping and physical product design. In terms of this class, I'm most excited to learn about operating a 3D printer and being able to build product models at home. In terms of my skillset, I'm hoping to be able to teach my peers tips and tricks with Illustrator and Photoshop, since I have 6+ years experience with them.
